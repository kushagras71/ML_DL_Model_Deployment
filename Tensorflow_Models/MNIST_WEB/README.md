# MNIST Classifier.

The TensorFlow model was built in JavaScript and whenever this script is executed i.e. the webpage is accessed or it is refreshed, 
the model start it training using the built-in MNIST dataset.

During training of the model the webpage displays the graph which shows the process of optimizing the weight in order to reduce the loss. The user can thus get a feel of the 
training process. Once the training is completed the prompt shows up telling that the model is trained and you can use it to make classifications. 

After training and making a classification the webpages looks somewhat as follows:
